# Fixed Income Bond Valuation: Prices and Yields

Bond price depends on:
- Cash flow features
- Market discount rate/yield to maturity (required return based on bond risk)

At issuance, the bond price is the PV of interest and principal cash flows.

## Bond types:
- Par bond: price = future value, coupon rate = market discount rate
- Discount bond: price < future value, coupon rate < market discount rate
- Premium bond: price > future value, coupon rate > market discount rate

## Yield-to-Maturity
- The YTM is the internal rate of return (IRR) on bond cash flows
- The YTM equates the present value of future cash flows to the bond's price
- Rate of return equals YTM if:
  - The bond is held to maturity
  - Full coupon and principal payments are made
  - All coupons are reinvested at YTM

Coupon effect:
- A lower coupon leads to a greater proportion of cash flow at maturity, magnifying the price change
- A higher coupon has less price sensitivity to changes in yield

Maturity effect:
- Longer-term bonds experience greater percentage price change than shorter-term bonds for the same change in market discount rates
- Maturity effect always holds for zero-coupon bonds at or above par value

Bonds with longer maturities have greater interest rate risk.

Convexity effect:
- The relationship between bond prices and yields is non-linear and "convex"
- Non-linear relationship
  - As yields decrease, the price increases at an increasing rate
  - As yields increase, the price decreases at a decreasing rate
- Positive convexity:
  - Price increase (when yields fall) is greater than the price decrease for an equivalent change in yield (when yields rise)
  - Benefit: gain more when yields fall and lose less when they rise
