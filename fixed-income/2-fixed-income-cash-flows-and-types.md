But how would a corporation pay the huge lump sum at the end?

### Amortized bonds
- Have fixed periodic payments that reduce the outstanding principal amount to zero till the maturity.
- Each payment goes towards the settlement of both interest and the principal.
  - Fully amortized bond: the annual payment (consisting of the coupon and the principal repayment) is constant, usually viewed as an annuit.
  - Partially amortized bond: consists of annual payments plus a balloon payment made at maturity to clear the outstanding principal amount of the bond.

### Sinking fund arrangements
- A sinking fund is set by the issuer over time to retire the bond.
- Each payment goes towards retiring the principal value of the bond.

## Coupon repayment structures
### Floating rate notes (FRNs)
- Coupon payments are linked to a reference rate such as LIBOR.

### Step-up coupon bonds
- May be fixed or floating but increases by a given margin at specified dates
  - For example: a callable bond with a yearly increase in coupon rate
- Step-up coupons protect the bondholders against rising interest rates
  - Rising interest rates: There is a high probability that the issuer will not call the bond, mainly in fixed-rate bonds.
  - Falling interest rates or stable rate: motivates the issuer to call the bond before coupon rate increases and interest expense increases.
 
### Credit-linked coupon bonds
- Coupons fluctuate with the bonds' credit rating changes
  - Increases (decreases) with credit rating downgrade (upgrade).
- Common with investors with doubts about the future creditworthiness of the issuer.
- Protects the investors against a poor economy since credit rating falls significantly during a recession.

### Payment-in-kind (PIK) coupon bonds
- Allows the issuer to pay interest in the form of additional amounts of the bond issued, instead of a cash payment.

### Deferred coupon bonds
- Coupons not made for the first couple of years, and then are higher than average.

### Index-linked bonds
- Linked to a particular index. Example: inflation-linked bonds - protects investors against inflation.
- Linkers: inflation-linked bonds issued by the government.

Callable bonds - gives the issuer the right to force the bondholders to sell the bonds back. This benefits the issuer because they can replace the old expensive bond with a newer cheaper one if the interest rates decline. 
There is a higher level of reinvestment risk for the investor.

Puttable bond - gives the bondholder the right to force the issuer to buy the bonds back.

Convertible bonds - gives the holder the right to exchange the bond for a specified number of common shares. The price of a convertible bond is usually higher.
